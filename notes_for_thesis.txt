Notes that might be useful for the final stage of the thesis

1. SpaceNet images were converted to 8-bit using min, max values calculated by the mean-3*std values.
What if I run the same algorithm for mean-2*std values? What if I don't calculate the histogram? What if I don't convert them
proportionally?

2. SpaceNet images were converted to have better contrast with CLAHE. What if I didn't use that ? Or what if
I used Adaptive Histogram Equalization?
