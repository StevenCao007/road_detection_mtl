Notes that might be useful for the final stage of the thesis

1. SpaceNet images were converted to 8-bit using min, max values calculated by the mean-3*std values.
What if I run the same algorithm for mean-2*std values? What if I don't calculate the histogram? What if I don't convert them
proportionally?

2. SpaceNet images were converted to have better contrast with CLAHE. What if I didn't use that ? Or what if
I used Adaptive Histogram Equalization?

3. Road detection from remote sensing imagery paper is very analytical. I can borrow exaplanations over theory for my thesis from there.

4. JointNet paper has a nice related work section: MNih, Saito 2 papers, Zhang, + theory for thesis

5. Consider using Group Normalization instead of Batch Normalization. Good explanation in the JointNet paper.

6. Focal loss : https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002
We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors
is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such 
that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse
set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training.

7. RCNN in the Recurrent Road detection and centerline extraction chinese paper. changed the cnn unit with a rcnn unit + applied multitask learning to improve results.
